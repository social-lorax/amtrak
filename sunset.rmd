### August 23

Off we go on the mirror image of the Empire Builder traveling along the southern border! Terri issued an ultimatum before setting off: either we upgrade to a roomette for this segment of the trip or she jumps ship and spends the rest of her days on Bourbon Street. So, for this segment we have a little section of the train to oursevles with a closing door (read: no masks!), completely horizontal beds, a shared shower, and access to complimentary meals in the dining car (so much for our coach class revolt).

More river borders: the Sabine River is the border between Louisiana and Texas. Upon crossing the river, we both were in Texas for the first time ever!

After passing through a similar landscape as Louisiana, we arrived in Houston.

Our roomette comes with complimentary meals and drinks and the seats fold out into two bunkbeds.

We continued on across Texas and arrived in San Antonio shortly after midnight.

The conductors announced that we would be stopped in San Antonio for about two hours (we were waiting for a new crew or passengers from another train, it is still unclear). Acting fast, I seized the moment, hopped off the train, ran a mile to the Alamo, and then ran back.

I made it back onto the train and Terri was sound asleep with no knowledge I ever left. In hindsight I had plenty of time to just walk there and back, but my heart was racing the whole time.
