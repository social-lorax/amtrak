### August 23

Off we go on the mirror image of the Empire Builder traveling along the southern border! Terri issued an ultimatum before setting off: either we upgrade to a roomette for this segment of the trip or she jumps ship and spends the rest of her days on Bourbon Street. So, for this segment we have a little section of the train to oursevles with a closing door (read: no masks!), completely horizontal beds, a shared shower, and access to complimentary meals in the dining car (so much for our coach class revolt).
