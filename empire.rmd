### August 14

All I have to say so far is this was very confusing! Unlike the Lake Shore Limited where Boston and New York met in Albany to form one long train to Chicago, the Empire Builder starts as one long train and eventually splits off with half going to Seattle and half going to Portland. There were so many lines and so many entrances to the train that I have no idea where I will end up! (I am at least taking comfort in the fact that other people on this train say they are going to Seattle, even though the conductor initially thought I was going to North Dakota….) I have a seat, I am by the window, and everything else will work itself out!

I’m not sure that I will see much today. Based on this map of estimated day/night location, it will likely be dark before we reach Minnesota. 

Update: I was just kidding!!! Look, it's a sunset over the Mississippi River between Wisconsin and Minnesota! (And then look at the day/night map because it is also really cool)

The map did not lie: it was dark before we got to Minneapolis and I went to bed shortly after leaving the. (Here's a rendition of me trying to take a good picture and what I actually took.)

### August 15

I woke up in North Dakota to some cows! I slept much better, but I am already starting to feel it in my neck and shoulders. I have a hotel stay after I get off this train, so I am looking forward to that, and I will need to schedule a massage for right when I get off the train in Manhattan! (Actually, now that I think about it, it might be that I carried a heavy backpack around Chicago for a few hours - who knows!) 

After my new showering routine, I grabbed my breakfast and espresso and headed to the observation car.

I have to be honest and say that North Dakota blended into Montana so I am not sure if this is the actual split. I remember thinking: "wow, there are a lot of hills/mountains here, I wonder where we are?" and seeing on Google we were well into Montana.

Either way, I spent the day in the observation car *observing* and also reading my book on Amtrak. (I'll start a new tab on the main page for some interesting things about that.) So far I have not purchased anything from the Cafe car and have subsisted off of the groceries I brought on board! As I wait to start dinner, we are racing the daylight towards Glacier National Park (Amtrak is not taking it as seriously as I am, unfortunately). The day/night map says we should have daylight right until we get to the park. The path through looks incredible, so I am hoping it is not completely pitch black. I also think we are splitting soon, so the moment of truth as to which destination I am headed towards is approaching...
