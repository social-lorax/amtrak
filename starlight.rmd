### August 17

Unfortunately, wildfires destroyed part of this route so the entire segment was canceled. We knew about this in advance, so we planned an extra night in Seattle, got plane tickets to Emeryville, and will spend a night in the Bay Area before hopping on the California Zephyr, the train I am most excited about!
